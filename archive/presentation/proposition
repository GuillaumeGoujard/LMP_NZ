# Proposition of slides for CE 295 presentation

- If (R) : robust presentation : to do imperatively, can be done with today's content
- Otherwise, if we have more time

## PART I : Introductory topics
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Give or Take : Hornsdale Battery"
        + Pictures : graph pricetaker assumption / pictures of batteries / maybe headlines
        + Comment : Introduction with elevator pitch :  they were not price takers !
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Introduction : Where, How and How much"
        + Text : one short paragraph with our goal : "Devise an optimization framework to yield optimal location $i$,
                capacity $u_max$ and bidding price/volume ($c^u_t$, $q_t^u$) for a battery pack over a nodal wholesale market"
        + Comment :  Short and punchy : link with the class : market + optimization
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "5 Challenges"
        + Table : 2 columns (Challenge / Solution or Assumption), 5 rows :
                - Uncertainty over bids / Assumption : perfect info
                - Uncertainty over demand / Assumption : perfect info
                - Spatial heterogenity / Solution: DC power flow
                - Multi-temporal dimension / Solution: Battery State of charge equations as a constraint
                - Endogenous LMPs : Non-linear objective function / Solution : linearized Mathematical Program under Equilibreum constraint
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Opening example : One node, One trading period, Unlimited Energy"
        + Graphs : Moura's aggregating supply + my 2 working examples
        + Equation : LMP = average price + congestion price
        + Comment : If bid 0 (self schedule) => prices fall !, Bid to LMP ? ... => Not that simple !
    


## PART II : Our model
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Optimization Problem"
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Challenges"
         Economic Dispatch under DC power flow assumption + constant marginal cost of generators is an LP.
            - Equilibreum conditions (A.K.A KKT conditions) of an L.P includes slack constraints are non-linear 
            in the optimization variables => Binary constraints 
            - The objective function is still non-linear => Strong duality 
    @ Slide :
        + Title : "One-node objective function linearization"
        
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Final MILP"
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Exognenous input the  bids"


## PART III : Our Results
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Why New Zealand ?"
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "From 300 Nodes to 19"
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Results over September 2019"


## PART IV : Conclusions and opening
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Conclusion"
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Special thanks"
        + Comment : Bertrand and Mathilde
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "References"
        + Comment : ...
