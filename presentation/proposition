# Proposition of slides for CE 295 presentation

- If (R) : robust presentation : to do imperatively, can be done with today's content
- Otherwise, if we have more time

## PART I : Introductory topics
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Give or Take : Hornsdale Battery"
        + Pictures : graph pricetaker assumption / pictures of batteries / maybe headlines
        + Comment : Introduction with elevator pitch :  they were not price takers !
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Introduction : Where, How and How much"
        + Text : one short paragraph with our goal : "Devise an optimization framework to yield optimal location,
                capacity and bidding price for a battery pack over a nodal wholesale market"
        + Comment :  Short and punchy : link with the class : market + optimization
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Opening example : One node, One trading period, Unlimited Energy"
        + Graphs : Moura's aggregating supply + my 2 working examples
        + Equation : LMP = average price + congestion price
        + Comment : If bid 0 (self schedule) => prices fall !, Bid to LMP ? ... => Not that simple !
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "5 Challenges"
        + Table : 2 columns (Challenge / Solution or Assumption), 5 rows :
                - Endogenous LMPs : Non-linear objective function / Assumption : MPEC
                - Uncertainty over bids / Assumption : perfect info
                - Uncertainty over NET demand / Assumption : perfect info
                - Spatial heterogenity / ED with DC power flow
                - Temporal "hetereogenity ?" / Battery State of charge



## PART II : Our model
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Optimization variables"
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Spatial and Temporal complexity"
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Light Optimization program"
    @ Slide :
        + Title : "Graphical objective function linearization"
    @ Slide (R) :
        + Title : "Final MILP"
