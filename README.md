Temporary README for Kieran.

Do the following:

1. Run the setup,


    python3 setup.py develop
    
2. Become aware of the structure of the repo

- In archive: all the junk py files we used in the past,
- Data is at the root since it can be considered as an input 
to the repo
- then you have the jupyter_notebook folder, in which you can 
write your .pyinb file
- finally you have the package in itself: lmpnz.
    - you can note that you will mainly call functions that I
    coded recently and saved in JupyterRessources


2. open and try to run main_article.py in jupyter_notebook

You should see:

   - a lot of  stuff in the terminal
   - the beautiful map of NZ
   - the loads
   - the scenario prices
   - the pricemaker/taker comparision graph
   - the results table written in latex in the terminal
   - finally the plot of the norm 1 deviation in function of capacity.
   
   
   If All works That's great! Otherwise tell me!
